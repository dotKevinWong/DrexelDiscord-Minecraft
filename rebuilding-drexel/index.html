								<h1>REBUILDING DREXEL IN MINECRAFT</h1>
							</header>
							<section>
								<h1>Guidelines</h1>
								<p>These are some of the building standards we are operating by:</p>
								<p>We are building the campus on a 1:1 scale where each block is considered to be 1x1x1 &#x33A5; or 1 meter cubed. Measurements obtained in feet can be converted to blocks using the scale of 1 meter = 3.28084 feet so approximately 3 feet equals one block with room for error/an extra block every 10 blocks. Also, it can be difficult to build small-scale things where walls would not realistically be a meter thick, so be sure to take details like that into account.</p>
								<p>To gain measurements for accuracy, we are using Google Earth and measuring distances using the ruler tool located on the left side of the screen. Google Earth can be found here: <b><a href="https://earth.google.com/web/">earth.google.com/web</a></b></p>
								<p>All buildings have to adhere to a general sense of topography where the land rises and sinks. Generally, roads will be created before buildings can start so that they can build alongside the streets and maintain a proper sense of distance from each other. Additionally, the dirt/grass flooring will be raised to match with the streets and we hope that buildings do not have empty voids underneath a single layer of flooring. We are using <b><a href="https://maps.psiee.psu.edu/preview/map.ashx?layer=7026">maps.psiee.psu.edu</a></b> to get a sense of land elevation.</p>
								<p>As for designing building exteriors, be sure to switch up your blocks so that buildings arenâ€™t flat single block walls. Using materials like sandstone or quartz that have multiple block variants can allow for smaller details while staying in the same color pallete. Also, when designing buildings with traditional architecture, consider sinking your windows a block backwards and having a front layer of detail which has no holes between it and the back window layer.</p>
								<p>Trees around campus are generally oak trees and are made both by hand and through growing saplings. Small and medium-sized trees are built by hand using oak fences and oak logs and placing leaves in a similar pattern, feel free to look around campus for examples.</p>
								<p>Lastly, builder status grants you the ability to place/remove blocks, but does not allow you to do it virtually anywhere. Using the application form, we can add you to specific land plots where you can build in a set area. This was put in place to prevent larger-scale griefing.</p>
